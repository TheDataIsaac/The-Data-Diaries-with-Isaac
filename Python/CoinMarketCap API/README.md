# How to Automate Cryptocurrency Data Collection with APIs

This repository contains Python code that shows you how to use APIs to automate the data collection process for cryptocurrencies. The code is based on the article [here](insert_article_link_here), which explains the concepts and logic behind the code in detail. The article is inspired by Alex Freberg's video.

## What You Will Learn

By exploring this project, you will learn how to:

- Use the CoinMarketCap API to get data about the top 15 cryptocurrencies.
- Store and manage the data efficiently in a Pandas DataFrame and a CSV file.
- Handle errors and exceptions to ensure the reliability of the data collection process.
- Calculate the mean percent changes for different time intervals, and gain insights into cryptocurrency performance.
