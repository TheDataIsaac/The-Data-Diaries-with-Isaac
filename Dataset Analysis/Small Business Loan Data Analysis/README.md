# Small Business Loan Data Analysis

Welcome to the Small Business Loan Data Analysis project! In this repository, we explore and analyze the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) dataset containing valuable insights into the U.S. Small Business Administration's (SBA) 7(a) loan program from fiscal year 2010 to 2019. The 7(a) loan program is the SBA's primary initiative for providing financial assistance to small businesses.
