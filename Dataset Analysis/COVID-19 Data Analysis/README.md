## COVID-19 Data Visualization Repository
This repository contains code and visualizations related to COVID-19 data analysis and visualization using Tableau. The dataset includes COVID-19 test and death data obtained from Our World in Data, which is processed and analyzed using Python and PostgreSQL. The repository aims to provide insights into the spread, and mortality rates of COVID-19 across different locations.

## Dataset
The repository includes the following code files:
CovidDeaths.csv: Contains the processed COVID-19 death data.
Covid Data per Continent.xlsx: A workbook with two worksheets. Contains the summary of the COVID-19 data by continent and the COVID-19 cases by date
CovidDeaths_rawdata.xlsx: Contains the unprocessed raw data for COVID-19 deaths.
CovidDeath Preprocessing.ipynb: Python code for preprocessing the COVID-19 death data.
Covid_SQL_Analysis.sql: PostgreSQL code for performing data analysis on the COVID-19 datasets.


## Tableau Visualizations
The repository includes a folder containing various Tableau visualizations created using the processed COVID-19 data. The visualizations provide insights into different aspects of the pandemic, including the COVID-19 Cases Distribution by Continent, Global COVID-19 Cases Over Time, Density of total deaths by location and dates, and more. 

You can also explore the visualizations by visiting my [Tableau Public profile](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jesufemi.oresanya). Feel free to follow me to stay updated on the latest visualizations and analysis.

## Article
If you want to learn more about how I explored and visualized the COVID-19 data using Python, PostgreSQL, and Tableau, you can read my article on Medium: [From Numbers to Stories: Navigating COVID-19 Data from Exploration to Visualization](https://medium.com/@thedataisaac/from-numbers-to-stories-navigating-covid-19-data-from-exploration-to-visualization-d0f9f135924c). In this article, I share my journey of data analysis and visualization, as well as some of the challenges and lessons I learned along the way. I hope you find it useful and informative.
