# Job Data Analysis Repository

Welcome to the Job Posting Data Analysis Repository! Here, you'll find all the resources and code related to the analysis of job posting data for positions like data analysts, engineers, and scientists. We've broken down the analysis process into several files and provided reference to two Medium posts for a detailed understanding.

## Data Source and Collection

The dataset used in this analysis was obtained from Luke Barousse's comprehensive data scraping project.

## Files

1. **jobdata pandas preprocessing.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the Python code for data preprocessing. It covers crucial steps like data cleaning, formatting, and engineering to get the dataset ready for analysis.

2. **jjobdata_processed_data.csv**: This CSV file holds the dataset after the preprocessing phase. It's the clean and structured data you can use for further analysis.

3. **job_data_sql.sql**: This SQL file contains the SQL queries used for analyzing the CSV file in a PostgreSQL database. It includes various queries to extract valuable insights from the data.

4. **tableau_visuals**: This directory contains images of the Tableau dashboard created to visualize the data. These visuals provide a clear representation of the insights gained from the analysis.

## Medium Posts
To get a comprehensive understanding of the data preprocessing and analysis process, check out these two Medium posts:

1. **[Data Preprocessing with Python](https://medium.com/@thedataisaac/mastering-data-preparation-for-your-dream-data-job-using-job-postings-data-4063f91fbc2b)**: This Medium post explains in detail how the data was cleaned, formatted, and engineered using Python with Pandas. It provides insights into the steps taken to prepare the dataset for analysis.

2. **[Data Analysis with PostgreSQL and Tableau (Unpublished)](https://medium.com/@thedataisaac/data-analytics-jobs-where-when-and-how-to-find-your-dream-role-4db35c41242c)**: In this Medium post, you will find a comprehensive explanation of how the preprocessed data was analyzed using PostgreSQL and visualized using Tableau. It includes details about SQL queries, Tableau dashboard creation, and the insights derived from the analysis.
